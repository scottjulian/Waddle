### Trees
* count the number of nodes in a complete binary tree
* invert a binary tree

### Arrays
* find duplicate within a given domain
* does a word exist in 2d grid
* find indices of 2 ints that add up to target value

### Strings
* find is a string is an anagram of a palindrome
* find the shortest palindrome of a given string

### Linked Lists
* reverse a single linked list in place between ```m``` and ```n```

### Clustering
* [K-Medoids Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-medoids)

### Misc
* calculate the angle between clock hands
* count the number of 1's islands in 2d matrix
* find if a number is a power of 2
